XML
========================

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language designed to store and transport data. It is self-descriptive, meaning the data is structured in tags that describe the information but doesn’t perform actions on its own. For example, an XML note might contain sender, receiver, heading, and message body data, but XML itself does not "do" anything—it’s simply a way of storing information that must be processed by software.
