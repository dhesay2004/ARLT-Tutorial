XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a flexible, text-based format used for storing and transporting data. 
It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. 
XML is used to structure data in a hierarchical, tree-like format, where elements are represented by tags. 
These elements can contain attributes and nested sub-elements, making XML a great choice for organizing complex data.
