XML Tutorial

XML
* XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language designed to store and transport data. It is self-descriptive, meaning the data is structured in tags that describe the information but doesn’t perform actions on its own. For example, an XML note might contain sender, receiver, heading, and message body data, but XML itself does not "do" anything—it’s simply a way of storing information that must be processed by software.
Unlike HTML, which is designed to display data, XML focuses on carrying data and doesn’t use predefined tags. XML tags are user-defined, allowing flexibility in how data is organized. This extensibility makes XML useful even when data formats change over time, as older applications can still process newer versions of XML data.
XML simplifies data sharing, transport, and compatibility between different systems or platforms, as it is stored in a plain text format. This makes it easier to exchange data between different software or hardware environments, ensuring data remains accessible across various devices and applications.
